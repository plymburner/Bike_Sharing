#  NYC Trip Data 

## Overview of the analysis:
We are looking to explore what is the driving force behind a bike share business in New York City to understand if it is a viable business for Des Moines, Iowa.

I will use pandas to update a csv file with New York Citibike data. The I will use Tableau to create Data Visualizations that are easy to understand. The goal of the visualizations is to show the following:

* The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Summary:
We were able to identify the peak hours (5 & 6PM) as well as the busiest day (Thursday) for Citibike users in New York City.  We also identified that males are the most popular segment.  We have gathered some useful information however more analysis is needed.  It would be helpful to understand demographic information of New York City vs Des Moines, Iowa.


### Additional visualizations that I would like to perform with the dataset
* Examine the relationship between the trip duration and the start location
* Examine the relationship between age and usertype
